## Smart contract architecture

Smart contracts in AElf are spread across the Kernel, the runtim and the SDK. The kernel defines the fundamental components and infrastructure associated with smart contracts. It also defines the abstractions for execution. Smart contract also heavily rely on the runtime modules and the sdk project.
