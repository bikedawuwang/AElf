## introduction

One of the major issues with current blockchain systems is scalability. This is why AElf side chains were introduced in the initial design. Itâ€™s envisioned that one sidechain is responsible for handling one or more similar business scenarios, distributing different tasks on multiple chains and improving the overall processing efficiency.

The main idea is that the sidechains are independent and specialized to ensure that the dapps running on them can perform efficiently and smoothly. A network link will exist between mainchain node and sidechain nodes, but the communication is mainly done through what's called a Merkle root.

The following sections of this documentation will give you an overview of the architecture of AElfs side chains. There will also be a guide explaining how to set up a mainchain and a side chain node.
